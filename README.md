# Agency Jekyll Theme Starter Template

This is the fastest and easiest way to get up and running on GitHub Pages.
Simply generate your own repository by clicking 
[here](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/generate), 
then replace the sample content with your own and configure for your needs.

If you want your website to be at `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`, that's what you must name your repo. If you want it to be like this: `https://raviriley.github.io/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/`, them make sure the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` matches the name of your repo.
